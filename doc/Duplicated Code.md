If you see the same code structure in more than one place, you can be sure that your program
will be better if you find a way to unify them. Duplication means that every time you read these 
copies, you need to read them carefully to see if thereâ€™s any difference. If you need to change 
the duplicated code, you have to find and catch each duplication.
