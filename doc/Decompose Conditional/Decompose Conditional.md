# Motivation

As with any large block of code, I can make my intention clearer by decomposing conditional logic and replacing each chunk of code with a function call named after the intention of that chunk. With conditions, I particularly like doing this for the conditional part and each of the alternatives. This way, I highlight the condition and make it clear what Iâ€™m branching on. I also highlight the reason for the branching.
